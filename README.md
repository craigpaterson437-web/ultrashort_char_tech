This repository contains code created during my masters project (under the suprvision of Dr Setevn Magennis and Ms Abigial Thom, working on single molecule fluorescene techniques using ultrafast lasers. The files are in the main working tools that I created to simulate experimental ideals or handle generated data. As such the code is quite rough and ready and potentially un-functional in some aspects. It is also quite sparsely commented at the time of first publication but I aim to improve this over time. 
gaussian_simulated_dispersion.py is the most useful to a wider audience as it models optical pulse dispersion under the effects of Group Delay Dispersion (GDD). It aligns closely with mathematical predictions and is wrapped up into a neat tool. There will be a sech^2 version coming in short order. 

The code is mostly in .ipynb notebooks as for me this is easier to work with. Furthermore most graphs have saving functionality to integrate with my workflow. 

At the end of my project I aim to publish all created tools and fully update this repository. 

If there are any questions regarding this repositoty feel free to contact me on 2649779p@student.gla.ac.uk. 

Thanks
